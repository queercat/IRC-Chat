# IRC-Chat
An IRC Chat Bot for Live OBS Chat Replay

# What is This 
---------------
A simple way to get yourself streaming along with your IRC chat. If you've ever wanted to overlay your IRC with your stream for whatever reason, afaik this is now the easiest way to do it.

# Installation
If you're on Linux (more likely) just clone it, download the tar, or use the binary.
If you're on Windows, same deal, clone it, download the zip, or use the binary (easiest if you don't understand or don't want much Python / CMD stuff).

# How To Use
--------------
Edit the config.json to your liking. SSL is tested, non-SSL is somewhat tested let me know if there's any issues. Currently no IRC password support but if desired contact me and I can probably add it within like an hour.

# Who am I?
-------------
Someone who likes to stream and use IRC.
